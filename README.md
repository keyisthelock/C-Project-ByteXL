🎓 PPS Project: Digital Noticeboard
Welcome to our C programming project for the Bytexl Nimbus course! This is a console-based application that tries to solve the problem of missing important college announcements.

🤔 Why we Built This
We wanted to create a program that mimics a real-world application using the concepts we learned in class (like Structures, Pointers, and Memory Management). Instead of just printing numbers, this program manages real data like notice titles, dates, and student subscriptions.

✨ What It Does
For Admins: You can act as an admin to post new notices about exams, holidays, or events.

For Students: You can "subscribe" to your department (e.g., CSE, ECE) and view a personalized feed of notifications.

Data Handling: It uses structures to keep data organized and dynamic memory so we don't waste RAM.
